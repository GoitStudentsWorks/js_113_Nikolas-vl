## About:
This project was created using Vite.
To accomplish the task, the following steps were taken:
1. Developed adaptive and semantic layout
Created responsive layout using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to ensure proper display across various devices. Enhanced SEO and accessibility through semantic tags.
2. Optimized graphics and website performance
Optimized graphics and performance by reducing image sizes, implementing SVG icons through sprites, and supporting Retina displays.
3. Implemented user-friendly navigation and interactivity
Created intuitive navigation: burger menu for mobile version, anchor links with smooth scrolling, hover effects, as well as sliders (Swiper.js) and accordion functionality (Accordeon.js).
4. Integrated feedback form
Added a form with email validation using regular expressions.
Implemented a POST request to the server for sending collaboration requests.
Provided user notifications about successful submission or errors.
5. Added modal window for notifications
Implemented a modal window to confirm request submissions.
The window can be closed by clicking a button, the backdrop, or pressing the Escape key.
6. Display of reviews from backend
Implemented review retrieval through API.
Thanks to these solutions, the website is fast, user-friendly, interactive, and effective for self-presentation to potential employers and clients.
